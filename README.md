This was the first "real" test in theodinproject's new html section.    This was set up to test our knowlege and execution of links and lists.   I set up the index as a table of contents for recipes.

I put the recipes in a separate folder under root and linked to them from the ToC page.

The ToC contains relative links to the recipe pages.  The recipe pages contain relative links to the image folder, and in one case, to each other.
